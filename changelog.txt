init/GEMlumi.xml is super important!!!!

removed all mention of telescopes

currently there's no implementation of slow controls?

fn just returns (ok(?)) -> question for my collab talk

config file has like 200 lines of old shitty calib code hacked together by
michael and tanvi (does anyone know what they're doing?)


currently calib constants stored in a 48 kB data array which isn't even
used AND there's an additional 48 kB for deadchannels

replaced deadchannesl with local bitmaps on each apv:
-> 250 * 2 * gemnum (6) bits = 3kb 375 bytes factor of 1000 reduction for
deadchannels 

unfortunately calib consts are still doubles and big, probably best to
parse them rather than put them on the stack?

miss me with that shit thats what Tanvi must have been working on when I
met her D: D: D:

many repeated functions for x/y data that do the same and should just be
wrappers, or even better let the axis distinction lie with the apv
